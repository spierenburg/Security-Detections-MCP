# Security Detections MCP

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets LLMs query a unified database of **Sigma**, **Splunk ESCU**, **Elastic**, **KQL**, **Sublime**, and **CrowdStrike CQL** security detection rules.

> **New here? Start with the [Setup Guide](./SETUP.md)** -- covers macOS, Windows (WSL & native), and Linux step by step.

## What's New in 3.0 - Autonomous Detection Platform

Version 3.0 transforms this MCP into a **fully autonomous detection engineering platform**. Feed it threat intelligence, and it automatically:

1. **Extracts TTPs** from threat reports, CISA alerts, or manual input
2. **Analyzes coverage gaps** against your existing detections
3. **Generates detections** in your SIEM's native format (SPL, KQL, EQL, or Sigma)
4. **Runs Atomic Red Team tests** against your lab environment
5. **Validates detections fire** by querying your SIEM
6. **Exports attack data** for reproducibility
7. **Stages DRAFT PRs** to your detection repo (never auto-merges)

> **Multi-SIEM**: Set `SIEM_PLATFORM` to `splunk`, `sentinel`, `elastic`, or `sigma` in your `.env`. The pipeline was built on Splunk + Attack Range but adapts to any SIEM. See the **[E2E Testing Guide](./docs/E2E-TESTING-GUIDE.md)** for complete setup instructions per platform.

### Architecture: LangGraph + Cursor Subagents

The 3.0 architecture uses two complementary systems:

| Component | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **LangGraph Pipeline** | Core autonomous workflow - portable, testable, CI/CD ready | `agents/` |
| **Cursor Subagents** | Interactive IDE agents for manual tasks | `.cursor/agents/` |

### Quick Start - Autonomous Mode

**Prerequisites**: Node.js 20+, an Anthropic API key. Full details in the [Setup Guide](./SETUP.md).

```bash
# Install the agents package
cd agents && npm install --registry https://registry.npmjs.org/

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set SIEM_PLATFORM, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, SECURITY_CONTENT_PATH

# Test with dry run first (uses mock data, no LLM calls)
DRY_RUN=true npm run orchestrate -- --type technique --input "T1566.004 Spearphishing Voice"

# Run with real LLM (creates actual detections)
npm run orchestrate -- --type technique --input "T1566.004 Spearphishing Voice"

# Or analyze a CISA alert
npm run orchestrate -- --type cisa_alert --url https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/...

# Or feed it a threat report
npm run orchestrate -- --type threat_report --file ./report.md

# Note: Use T1566.004 for testing - it has no existing coverage so will create a detection
# T1003.001 has 100+ existing detections, so the pipeline will correctly skip it (no gap)
```

                                          └──────────────────┘
```

### MCP Integration

The autonomous pipeline integrates with existing MCPs:
- **security-detections** - Coverage analysis and gap identification
- **splunk-mcp** - Detection validation (`run_detection`, `export_dump`)
- **mitre-attack** - Technique lookups

### Human-in-the-Loop

**CRITICAL**: The system NEVER auto-commits or auto-merges. All PRs are created as **DRAFT** requiring human review:

```
[PR Stager] ✓ security_content DRAFT PR created: https://github.com/splunk/security_content/pull/123
[PR Stager] ✓ attack_data DRAFT PR created: https://github.com/splunk/attack_data/pull/456
```

See the [Autonomous Platform Documentation](./docs/AUTONOMOUS.md) for full details, and the [E2E Testing Guide](./docs/E2E-TESTING-GUIDE.md) for per-SIEM setup (Splunk, Sentinel, Elastic, Sigma).

## 🆕 MCP Prompts - Expert Detection Workflows

This server includes **11 pre-built MCP Prompts** that provide structured, expert-level workflows for common security detection tasks. Instead of figuring out which tools to use and in what order, just ask for a prompt by name and get a comprehensive, professional analysis.

### How to Use Prompts in Cursor

Simply ask Claude to use a prompt by name:

```
You: "Use the ransomware-readiness-assessment prompt"
You: "Run apt-threat-emulation for APT29"  
You: "Execute the executive-security-briefing prompt for our CISO"
You: "Use detection-engineering-sprint with capacity 5 and focus on ransomware"
```

### Available Prompts

| Prompt | Description | Arguments |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `ransomware-readiness-assessment` | Comprehensive kill-chain analysis with risk scoring and remediation roadmap | `priority_focus`: prevention/detection/response/all |
| `apt-threat-emulation` | Assess coverage against specific threat actors (APT29, Lazarus, Volt Typhoon, etc.) | `threat_actor` (required), `include_test_plan` |
| `purple-team-exercise` | Generate complete test plans with procedures and expected detections | `scope` (tactic or technique), `environment` |
| `soc-investigation-assist` | Investigation helper with triage guidance, hunting queries, and escalation criteria | `indicator` (required), `context` |
| `detection-engineering-sprint` | Prioritized detection backlog with user stories and acceptance criteria | `sprint_capacity`, `threat_focus` |
| `executive-security-briefing` | C-level report with business risk language and investment recommendations | `audience`: board/ciso/cto, `include_benchmarks` |
| `cve-response-assessment` | Rapid assessment for emerging CVEs and threats | `cve_or_threat` (required) |
| `data-source-gap-analysis` | Analyze telemetry requirements for improved detection coverage | `target_coverage` |
| `detection-quality-review` | Deep-dive quality analysis of detections for a specific technique | `technique_id` (required) |
| `threat-landscape-sync` | Align detection priorities with current threat landscape | `industry` |
| `detection-coverage-diff` | Compare coverage against threat actors or baseline | `compare_against` (required) |

### Example: Ransomware Assessment

```
You: "Use the ransomware-readiness-assessment prompt"

Claude will automatically:
1. Get baseline stats with get_stats
2. Analyze ransomware-specific gaps with identify_gaps
3. Review coverage by tactic with analyze_coverage  
4. Map gaps to the ransomware kill chain
5. Generate prioritized remediation roadmap
6. Output a professional report with risk scores
```

### Example: APT Threat Assessment

```
You: "Run apt-threat-emulation for Volt Typhoon"

Claude will:
1. Research Volt Typhoon using MITRE ATT&CK data
2. Get all 81 techniques attributed to the group
3. Check your detection coverage for each technique
4. Calculate coverage percentage and identify blind spots
5. Generate a purple team test plan (optional)

## 🆕 MCP Resources - Readable Context

MCP Resources let LLMs read context directly without tool calls. Perfect for understanding the current state before making decisions.

### Available Resources

| Resource URI | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `detection://stats` | Current inventory statistics |
| `detection://coverage-summary` | Tactic-by-tactic coverage percentages |
| `detection://gaps/ransomware` | Current ransomware detection gaps |
| `detection://gaps/apt` | Current APT detection gaps |
| `detection://top-techniques` | Top 20 techniques with most coverage |

Resources are automatically available in Cursor's context when needed.

## 🆕 Argument Completions

The server provides **autocomplete suggestions** as you type argument values:

| Argument | Completions From |
|----------|-----------------|
| `technique_id` | Your indexed MITRE technique IDs (T1059.001, etc.) |
| `cve_id` | Your indexed CVE IDs (CVE-2024-27198, etc.) |
| `process_name` | Process names in your detections (powershell.exe, etc.) |
| `tactic` | All 14 MITRE tactics |
| `severity` | informational, low, medium, high, critical |
| `source_type` | sigma, splunk_escu, elastic, kql, sublime, crowdstrike_cql |
| `threat_profile` | ransomware, apt, initial-access, persistence, etc. |

This prevents typos and helps discover what values are available in your detection corpus.

## 🆕 Structured Errors & Suggestions

When errors occur or no results are found, the server returns **helpful JSON responses** instead of plain strings:

```json
// Missing required argument
{
  "error": true,
  "code": "MISSING_REQUIRED_ARG",
  "message": "technique_id is required",
  "examples": ["T1059.001", "T1547.001", "T1003.001"],
  "hint": "Use format T####.### (e.g., T1059.001 for PowerShell)"
}

// No results found
{
  "results": [],
  "technique_id": "T1234.999",
  "suggestions": {
    "message": "No detections found for this technique",
    "similar_techniques": ["T1234.001", "T1234.002"],
    "try_search": "search(\"T1234\") for broader results",
    "tip": "Parent techniques (T1234) may catch sub-techniques"
  }
}
```

This helps LLMs self-correct and suggest alternatives without getting stuck.

## 🆕 Interactive Tools (Cursor 0.42+)

These tools use **MCP Elicitation** to present forms for interactive configuration:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `prioritize_gaps` | Analyze gaps and get prioritized recommendations |
| `plan_detection_sprint` | Interactive sprint configuration with capacity/focus/data source options |

Example:
```
You: "Help me prioritize which ransomware gaps to fix first"
Tool: prioritize_gaps(threat_profile="ransomware")
→ Returns P0/P1/P2 prioritized gaps with selection guidance

These tools do heavy processing server-side and return minimal, actionable data:

| Tool | Description | Output Size |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `analyze_coverage(source_type?)` | Get coverage stats by tactic, top techniques, weak spots | ~2KB |
| `identify_gaps(threat_profile, source_type?)` | Find gaps for ransomware, apt, persistence, etc. | ~500B |

## Claude Code Skills

This repo includes [Claude Code Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) in `.claude/skills/` that teach Claude efficient workflows:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `coverage-analysis` | Efficient coverage analysis using the token-optimized tools |

**Why skills?** Instead of figuring out methodology each time (wasting tokens), skills teach Claude once.

You can also install personal skills to `~/.claude/skills/` for cross-project use.

### Example: Efficient Coverage Analysis

```
You: "What's my Elastic coverage against ransomware?"

AI uses skills + efficient tools:
1. analyze_coverage(source_type="elastic")     → Stats by tactic
2. identify_gaps(threat_profile="ransomware")  → Prioritized gaps
3. suggest_detections(technique_id="T1486")    → Fix top gap

Total: ~5KB of data vs ~500KB with traditional tools
```

## Example Workflows

### Using MCP Prompts (Recommended for Complex Tasks)

```
# Comprehensive ransomware assessment
You: "Use the ransomware-readiness-assessment prompt"
→ Full kill-chain analysis with risk scoring and remediation roadmap

# Assess coverage against a specific APT
You: "Run apt-threat-emulation for Volt Typhoon"
→ Technique-by-technique coverage analysis with test plan

# Generate a sprint backlog
You: "Use detection-engineering-sprint with capacity 5 focusing on apt threats"
→ Prioritized user stories with acceptance criteria

# Executive reporting
You: "Run executive-security-briefing for the board"
→ Business-risk language with investment recommendations
```

## ⚠️ Limitations & Transparency

We believe in being honest about what this tool can and cannot do. Here are the current limitations:

### Pattern Extraction Limitations

The Detection Engineering Intelligence features extract patterns **dynamically** from your detection corpus, but have some inherent limitations:

| Format | Field Extraction | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **Splunk SPL** | ✅ Excellent | Extracts from data models, `by` clauses, `stats` commands, `where` filters |
| **Sigma** | ✅ Excellent | Full YAML parsing of detection logic |
| **KQL** | ⚠️ Good | Dynamic extraction from `project`, `extend`, `where`, `summarize by`, `join on` |
| **Elastic** | ⚠️ Good | Dynamic extraction from `field:value` patterns, EQL `where` clauses |

**What this means:**
- **SPL and Sigma**: Highly accurate pattern extraction from full detection corpus
- **KQL and Elastic**: Uses regex-based dynamic extraction that catches most patterns, but may miss:
  - Unusual field naming conventions
  - Complex nested expressions
  - Custom functions or operators

### Coverage Analysis Limitations

- **MITRE mappings depend on source data** - If a detection doesn't have MITRE tags, we can't map it
- **Gap analysis is relative** - "Gaps" are based on threat profiles, not absolute coverage requirements
- **Cross-platform comparisons** - Different platforms have different capabilities; raw counts don't tell the whole story

### Client Feature Availability

Some v2.1 features depend on **client support**:

| Feature | Requires | Fallback |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Elicitation** | Client MCP elicitation support | Parameter-based confirmation (`confirm: true`) |
| **Sampling** | Client MCP sampling support | Direct analysis without LLM enhancement |
| **Resource Subscriptions** | Client subscription support | Poll resources manually |

**Note**: As of January 2025, Cursor may not fully support elicitation and sampling. The MCP gracefully falls back to alternative methods when these features aren't available.

### Reporting Issues

Found a limitation or inaccuracy? Please [open an issue](https://github.com/MHaggis/Security-Detections-MCP/issues) with:
1. The detection format (Sigma, Splunk, Elastic, KQL)
2. An example query that wasn't extracted correctly
3. Expected vs actual behavior

We continuously improve the pattern extraction based on community feedback.

## 🧠 Tribal Knowledge

**Tribal Knowledge** is the analytical memory system that helps future agents understand WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT was detected. It's like having a senior analyst's notebook that persists across sessions.

### What is Tribal Knowledge?

Traditional detection systems store facts: "We have 5 detections for T1059.001." Tribal Knowledge stores reasoning: "We prioritized T1059.001 because it's used in 80% of ransomware attacks, and our current detections miss base64-encoded PowerShell, which is why we added detection X."

### Knowledge Graph Tables

The knowledge graph consists of four interconnected tables:

1. **Entities** - Things you care about (threats, techniques, detections, data sources, campaigns)
2. **Relations** - How entities connect ("APT29 uses T1059.001", "Detection X covers T1059.001")
3. **Decisions** - Analytical reasoning and decision-making context
4. **Learnings** - Insights, patterns, and lessons learned

### How It Helps Future Agents

When you log a decision like:
```json
log_decision(
  context: "Ransomware gap analysis",
  decision: "Prioritize T1486 (Data Encrypted for Impact)",
  reasoning: "This is the final stage of ransomware attacks. Without detection here, we can't prevent data loss.",
  tags: ["ransomware", "priority", "data-protection"]
)
```

Future agents can retrieve this context when analyzing ransomware coverage, understanding not just that T1486 is important, but WHY it was prioritized.

### Example Workflow

```
1. Analyze ransomware gaps → identify_gaps("ransomware")
2. Log decision → log_decision("Prioritized T1486 because...")
3. Create entity → create_entity("Ransomware Campaign 2024", "threat")
4. Link detection → link_detection_to_entity("det_123", "Ransomware Campaign 2024", "detects")
5. Future agent → get_relevant_decisions("ransomware") → understands context
```

## 🔬 Detection Engineering Intelligence

**Detection Engineering Intelligence** learns patterns from your detection corpus and helps you create better detections faster.

### Pattern Learning from 4 Sources

The system automatically extracts patterns from:
- **Sigma rules** - YAML-based detection logic
- **Splunk SPL** - Search Processing Language queries
- **KQL queries** - Microsoft Kusto Query Language
- **Elastic queries** - Elastic Detection Rules (EQL, KQL, Lucene)

### Automatic Template Generation

When you need a detection for T1059.001 (PowerShell), the system:
1. Analyzes all existing T1059.001 detections across formats
2. Extracts common patterns (process names, command-line arguments, base64 encoding)
3. Generates a template with placeholders for your specific environment
4. Suggests improvements based on learned patterns

### Field and Macro References

The system tracks:
- Which fields/macros are commonly used for each technique
- Cross-platform field mappings (e.g., `process_name` in Splunk vs `ProcessName` in KQL)
- Best practices for field usage in different contexts

### Learning from User Feedback

When you improve a detection or correct a pattern:
- The system learns from your changes
- Future template generation incorporates your improvements
- Field suggestions become more accurate over time

### Example Workflow

```
1. Extract patterns → extract_patterns("T1059.001")
2. Review patterns → get_patterns("T1059.001", "splunk")
3. Generate template → generate_template("T1059.001", "splunk", "Sysmon")
4. Customize template → (edit generated detection)
5. System learns → (automatically improves future templates)
```

## 🔗 Using with MITRE ATT&CK MCP

**This MCP pairs perfectly with [mitre-attack-mcp](https://github.com/MHaggis/mitre-attack-mcp)** for complete threat coverage analysis:

| MCP | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **security-detections-mcp** | Query 8,100+ detection rules + 11 expert workflow prompts |
| **mitre-attack-mcp** | ATT&CK framework data, threat groups, Navigator layers |

### With MCP Prompts (Easiest)

The prompts automatically leverage both MCPs for comprehensive analysis:

```
You: "Run apt-threat-emulation for APT29"

The prompt automatically:
1. Uses mitre-attack-mcp to get APT29's profile and techniques
2. Uses security-detections-mcp to check coverage for each technique
3. Calculates coverage percentage and identifies gaps
4. Generates purple team test plan
5. Outputs professional report with recommendations
```

```
You: "Use threat-landscape-sync for the finance industry"

The prompt automatically:
1. Gets top threat actors from mitre-attack-mcp
2. Filters by industry relevance
3. Analyzes your coverage against each actor
4. Prioritizes detection investments
5. Creates strategic roadmap
```

### With Tools Directly (More Control)

```
You: "What's my coverage against APT29?"

LLM workflow (3 calls, ~10KB total):
1. mitre-attack-mcp → get_group_techniques("G0016")     # APT29's TTPs
2. detections-mcp → analyze_coverage(source_type="elastic")  # Your coverage
3. mitre-attack-mcp → find_group_gaps("G0016", your_coverage) # The gaps

Result: Prioritized gap list, not 500KB of raw data
```

### Generate Navigator Layer

```
You: "Generate a Navigator layer for my initial access coverage"

LLM workflow:
1. detections-mcp → get_technique_ids(tactic="initial-access")  # Get covered technique IDs
2. mitre-attack-mcp → generate_coverage_layer(covered_ids, "Initial Access Coverage")

→ Returns ready-to-import Navigator JSON
```

### Install Both Together (Recommended)
